# Metaverse Overview

## What is the Metaverse?

The term ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù is credited to Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel ‚ÄúSnow Crash‚Äù, in which he envisioned lifelike avatars who met¬†in realistic 3D buildings and other virtual reality environments.

Since then, various developments have made mileposts on the way towards a real¬†metaverse: an online virtual world which¬†incorporates augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, video and other means of rich communication. 

As the metaverse expands and becomes more intricate, it will offer a hyper-real alternative world for humans to¬†coexist in.

To interact with the metaverse today, you need external physical controls such as VR headsets and gaming-like controllers. However, the landscape of devices is evolving quickly to provide more seamless integrations with movement and a fully immersive experience.

We will wear more advanced VR headsets, clothes with sensors which emulate our movements and contact lenses with embedded displays. We may not even need to wear anything, as many augmented reality technologies can use video, 3D scanning and motion detection and translate them into actions on the Metaverse.

Paradoxically, there is not one single metaverse, but rather a multitude of metaverses. Each was created and is maintanied by a parent company or group, and works according to its own rules. Today, the existing metaverses work independently and do not communicate or interact with each other. 

In the future, with the harmonization of the experience and the technologies underlying the metaverse and tighter integrations between metaverses, we will have a close to unified metaverse experience - the Multiverse - where we'll be able to move seamlessly between different metaverses.

For humans and consumers, the metaverse and multiverse extend beyond the virtual experience, into commercer of products and services, either completely virtual or also partly physical - like a **Metavini Wine NFT**.
 

## üó∫ Metavini's WineLand

We want to build the best virtual experiences around wine in our own space of the metaverse - the **WineLand**.                

WineLand is a one-stop-shop for the best wine products and experiences, sourced from around the world.

Inside the WineLand you may:

- Participate in wine tastings - Meet virtually to taste and enjoy wine sourced by Metavini.
- Visit stores, wineries and wine museums from anywhere in the world.
- Get to know the wine making and harvesting processes live.
- Interact with winemakers on-the-fly, share info your own production or collection, ask them for advice.
- Participate live in global wine events, meetings and contests, wherever you are.
- Producers and collectors can create their own stores, trade wine NFTs and offer premium experiences.

We are following closely where the Metaverse is heading and we have a clear vision of the right place for WineLand to flourish. 
We will begin our own journey into the metaverse starting from Q1 2023 and expect to provide these experiences in full in the upcoming 2-3 years.

However, you can get involved right now by sharing how the WineLand could work for you!
