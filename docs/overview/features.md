## Trade

Easily trade the proof of ownership of a physical wine asset through our NFT Marketplace.

Buy, sell or participate in auctions knowing that your wine is stored in perfect conditions at one of our certified wine cellars.

## Collect

The NFTs that you bought in the marketplace will be stored in your wallet, your decentralized digital wine cellar.

You will be able to watch in style your digital cellar value increase while the wine is aging or simply share it with your friends to show them your latest acquisitions.
