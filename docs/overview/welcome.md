# Welcome to Metavini 🍷

Let's dive deeper into the **Metavini Ecosystem**.

Metavini is a new decentralized ecosystem that connects wine producers, consumers and collectors.

Our NFT marketplace connects producers to consumers and collectors directly. By removing intermediaries, we are ensuring the value of wine is kept in the hands of owners at all times.


## Our vision

Metavini was born to provide the rails for the wine industry to enter Web3 and the Metaverse. 

We are a decentralized ecosystem that connects all the participants of the wine industry: producers, storage facilities, consumers, collectors and traders.

We are changing the experience of owning, trading and enjoying wine, by enabling a new ownership model through our NFTs.

By eliminating intermediaries, we are ensuring the value of wine assets is directly in the hands of the owners, while keeping trading and enjoying wine just a few clicks away. 


 
## Our mission

### Augmenting the wine industry

> Our NFTs are a new way to own, experience and appreciate wine.
> 
> Using the latest Web3 technologies, we are enabling a direct channel between connoisseurs and collectors and some of the highest valued wines, wineries and producers.


### Enabling global trade of wine NFTs

> We offer a new way for wine lovers to invest in and trade wine NFTs, from anywhere in the world.
> 
> By eliminating intermediaries and securing storage and handling, the value of the wine will be in the hands of their owners, for as long as they choose.

### Adding Value

> Beyond ownership and authenticity, we add value for producers and owners through the securitization of premium wine products.
> 
> Our NFTs are covered for the expenses of storing the underlying assets - for months, years or decades. We do this through secure processes of collection and storage across a network of trusted storage facilities.
