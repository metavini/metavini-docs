# Delivery at Home

- For the best possible experience, Metavini aims to ensure handling from storage to last-mile delivery, handing the physical wine assets directly to their owners or trusted custodians.
- Whenever a claim to enjoy wine is triggered, Metavini connects directly to the owner and presents the options and terms applicabble for the delivery, both at the requested location and/or on Metavini's proposed locations.
- If the owner accepts, Metavini delivers. If not, the NFT can be traded or stored for later.

## Delivery Costs

- Delivery costs will vary depending on the available channels and the required safety and security safeguards from storage to delivery.
- Import/export and customs clearing fees and other taxes will also be due in line with the applicable regulatory and tax frameworks of the sourcing and delivery geographies.
