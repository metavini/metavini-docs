# Storage Facilities


- Producers, collectors and restaurants can now monetize storing wine using Metavini.
- We are working with 3 types of storage facilities operated by:
  - Metavini, including hosting the Metavini Collection.
  - Partner Producers and renowned collectors and restaurants.
  - Third-parties specialized in wine storage.
- Metavini's strategy for storage is firstly knit to the geographies and producers from where our wine offer is sourced. Where we go next for storage and faster distribution and delivery depends on where wine enjoying is most in demand.
- The Web3 and Metavini offer unrivaled potential for wine assets to increase in value. Soon enough, some wines may require the same level of storage safety and security as some other high value commodities, traditionally stored at Banks.   
- Metavini will continue to grow as more locations prove suitable and sustainable for storage and regional distribution of our products.
