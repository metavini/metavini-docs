# Metavini Documentation

Metavini Docs is the knowledge base of our ecosystem.

Here you can find information on all that matters about the Metavini ecosystem.

Our docs will be a growing collection of artifacts, which will be updated and enriched periodically, as we move forward. Updates will span from the work of the Metavini team and from the contributions and feedback of the community.

The Metavini Docs project is stored on a Github public repository. In case you want to contribute actively, create a guide or fix a bug, feel free to create a pull request.


# Metavini Blog

Relevant updates for the Metavini ecosystem, including the release of new features and documentation, will be posted on our blog.

Blog entries related to new releases will have the changelog and details on the new features.
